Documentation is an essential part of making any open source project useful to users. But it's not always developers' top priority, as they may be more focused on making their application better than on helping people use it. This is why making it easier to publish documentation is so valuable to developers. In this tutorial, I'll show you one option for doing so: combining the Docsify documentation generator with GitHub Pages.

By default, GitHub Pages prompts users to use Jekyll, a static site generator that supports HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll "Jekyll") generates a static website from documentation files encoded in Markdown format, which GitHub automatically recognizes due to their .md or .markdown extension. While this setup is nice, I wanted to try something else.

Fortunately, GitHub Pages' HTML file support means you can use other site-generation tools, including Docsify, to create a website on the platform. Docsify is an MIT-Licensed open source project with [features](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=features "features") that make it easy to create an attractive advanced documentation site on GitHub Pages.
